				According to the American Kennel Club, the Lab has held the designation as
				America's favorite dog breed now for 26 consecutive years.  The Labrador
				Retriever that we know of today is actually is a descendent of the
				"St. John's Water Dog", which is a cross-breed of the small water dogs that
				populated Newfoundland, Canada and the Newfoundland dog breed.  Labs are
				strong swimmers and great hunting companions.  Because of their intelligence
				and trainability, Labs often serve as guide dogs, therapy dogs, or service dogs.
				The Lab was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1917.
